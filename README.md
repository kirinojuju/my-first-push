1. Name two Linux commands from this course that you found most valuable. For each:

    - Briefly describe its function
    - Explain why it's essential for new engineers (in your own words)

    Answer  `chmod`
    - Changes the access permissions (read, write, execute) of files and directories.
    
    - Understanding file permissions is the absolute foundation of system administration and cybersecurity. As engineers, we need to ensure that our scripts are executable but also that sensitive configuration files are locked down and protected from unauthorized access. `chmod` gives you direct control over system security at the file level.
  
   Answer '-ls'
   - lists the names of files and folders in your current directory.
   - It is one of the most fundamental utilities used to list directory contents

2. After one and a half years in the ISNE program, what advice would you give to prospective ISNE students? 

    - Welcome to ISNE! Balancing software engineering, hardware, and network architecture can be demanding, but it is incredibly rewarding. My biggest piece of advice is to actively practice what you learn outside of the classroom. Whether you are coding in C++, experimenting with data structures, or navigating Linux command-line tools, hands-on experience is where the concepts truly click. Don't be intimidated by the complex math or difficult labs; they form the foundation of everything you will build in your career. Find the specific area that excites you—whether that is cybersecurity, network infrastructure, or application development and dive deep into it. Finally, build a strong support system with your classmates; collaborating and debugging together will be your best resource.
